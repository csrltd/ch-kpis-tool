Alphonse:
This is cool, we'll review tomorrow. By the way, do not delete your past reportings, we
may need them for tracking later. You had forgotten to change site title and and index title in the core.urls. I change it.

Wednesdays'17th update

today we worked on filtering the data of each hospital in the table that contains the totals of each measures field.

we are now trying to see how we can refactor and change few things to have clean codes


29th June
I added the filter for measures on the graph on the general hospital dashboard and single hospital dashboard. When a user selects a particular measure, the graph will display the data for that measure on the line graph. On the general hospital dashboard, the colors are now consistent with the colors on the turnover graph. However, the values displayed on the line graph for the measure, are calculated wrongly. That is the next issue I'm left to fix and feedback will be completed.
