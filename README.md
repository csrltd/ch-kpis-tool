Monday'15th update

Today we have updated some of the dead links that were on the app.

the dead links were: signup link that takes a user to the signup page in case they are on the login page and the login link that takes a user to the login page in case they are on the signup page. the remaining link is the logout link.

we also added the total monthly readmissions from each hospital from January to December 2022. 

we are now working on adding the total of all the Measures table's fields to the table. 

to view the changes that we made you will have to pull on the backend and any hint or assistance would be highly appreciated.
